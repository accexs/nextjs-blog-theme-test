# Some title for this

The idea is to have this great article.

Lets see some inline code `contactMatcher := matcher.NewContactMatcher(contacts, matcher.NewMatchingWeights(), matcher.GetAccuracyThresholds())` now we'll see a block code:

```
func NewMatchingWeights() MatchingWeights {
    return MatchingWeights{
       Email:     4.0,
       Address:   3.0,
       ZipCode:   2.0,
       FirstName: 1.5,
       LastName:  1.5,
    }
}
```

And we can check some bullets here:

*   one of this

*   two of this

*   and the last one
